# chitty-rc

A Crappy IRC server in Go. 

Based on the specification and tests of the pedagogical IRC project 
[chirc](https://github.com/uchicago-cs/chirc) as an attempt to learn some Go. 

Using Google's [Bazel](bazel.io) build system. If that is installed, running `bazel build`
should compile the project. 

It also includes several automated tests for students to verify
the correctness of their implementation.

Please see http://chi.cs.uchicago.edu/chirc/ for a specification of the chirc
project, including specific assignments.

Have not figured out how to run the tests with Bazel yeet.
