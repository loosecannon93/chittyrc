# chitty-rc

A Crappy IRC server in Go. 

Based on the specification and tests of the pedagogical IRC project 
[chirc](https://github.com/uchicago-cs/chirc) as an attempt to learn some Go. 

Using Google's [Bazel](bazel.io) build system. If that is installed, running `bazel build`
should compile the project.
